I'm a frontend developer with a passion for Star Wars and a love for creating with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. I'm currently learning TypeScript to take my skills to the next level and create more robust and scalable web applications.

When I'm not battling the dark side of coding bugs, you can find me exploring new galaxies, binge-watching Star Wars movies and series, or tinkering with the latest tech gadgets.

### My Tech Stack

- **Languages:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript
- **Frameworks and Libraries:** React

### Fun Fact

Did you know that the iconic opening crawl from Star Wars was created using a combination of practical and computer-generated effects? It was one of the first examples of this kind of filmmaking and helped revolutionize the industry.
